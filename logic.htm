								<h1>Logic Puzzles! <small>yuup</small></h1>

							<!--<img class = "featureImg" src="images/image1.jpg">--> <!--Insert Image here once appropriate one is found-->
							
							<p>Since graduating college I have been getting asked quite a bit of logic questions by employers. Some easy and
							   others not so much. I have learned that it takes quite a bit of confidence to be able to solve these problems while 
							   your future employer and potentially other members of the company are staring you down waiting for a solution
							   (even if there easy!). That situation being all too familiar to me I had decided to spend some time practicing these logic
							   puzzles a little bit every day. Here are some questions I have compiled from my own personal interview experiences as well 
							   as finding them on the web. Sources for where I found these questions as well as many many more will be posted at the bottom of this page.

							<h3>That Bridge...</h3>
							
							<p>If you're at all in tune with the logic and/or Computer Science community, chances are you have heard at least
							   one question concerning a bridge and trying to get someone or something across in an efficient manner. Heres just
							   one of them.</p>
							   
							<p>There are four people trying to cross a bridge at night named A, B, C, and D. A can cross
							   the bridge in one minute, B in two minutes, C in five minutes, and D in ten minutes. Only two people
							   can cross the bridge at a time otherwise it will break and they must use the flashlight to see otherwise 
							   they will fall off. There is only one flashlight. The faster of two people crossing must walk
							   at the same pace as the slow one. What is the fastest way to get everyone across the bridge?</p>

							<h3>Coins coins coins...</h3>
							
							<p>This is the easy version of the coin weighing problem. The harder one will be up soon.</p>
							   
							<p>You have eight coins and they all weigh the same except for one. The defective coin weighs less
							   than the rest. How can you determine the defective coin with just two weighings on a balance scale?</p>

							<h3>Bears</h3>
							
							<p>Very easy but fun question I found online.</p>
							   
							<p>If a bear walks one mile south, turns left and walks one mile to the east and then turns 
							   left again and walks one mile north and arrives at its original position, what is the
							   color of the bear? <small>where did color come from?</small></p>

							<h3>Beans</h3>
							
							<p>Heres one of countless logic questions concerning some sort of beans placed into various jars.</p>
							   
							<p>There are five jars of beans. Each of the beans weigh ten grams, except for beans in one of the jars
							   where they weigh nine grams. With only one weighing of a scale how can you determine which of the jars
							   contain the nine gram beans? (NOT a balance scale)</p>

							<h3>Gold and Workers</h3>
							
							<p>I really enjoyed this problem. According to the website I found it on it is a question Microsoft asks.</p>
							   
							<p>You've got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay them. The gold bar is segmented 
							   into seven connected pieces. You must give them a piece of gold at the end of every day. If you are only
							   allowed to make two breaks into the gold bar, how do you pay your worker?</p>
